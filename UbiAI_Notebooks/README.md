# Notebooks

Welcome to the **Notebooks** section of the **Ubiai Incorporated LLM** repository! This area is dedicated to interactive, hands-on learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) through practical examples, experiments, and guided tutorials.

## About This Section

In this folder, you'll find a collection of well-documented notebooks designed to help you learn about:
- **Model Exploration and Analysis**
- **Data Generation and Processing**
- **Fine-Tuning and Customization of Models**
- **Evaluation and Testing of Model Performance**
- **Advanced Applications (e.g., RAG, Agents, and more)**

Whether you're a beginner eager to learn the basics or an advanced practitioner looking to refine your skills, these notebooks provide valuable insights and actionable code.

## **Running The Notebooks**
To run these notebooks in a cloud environment, simply open the files using Google Colab. You can either upload the notebook or use the ‚ÄúOpen in Colab‚Äù option if provided.

## üîß How To Learn From These Notebooks

Each notebook is self-contained and richly commented, designed to guide you through various aspects of LLMs:

- **Introduction to LLMs:** Basics of model architecture and usage.
- **Step-by-step Walkthroughs:** Practical examples of use cases.
- **Performance evaluation:** Techniques for evaluating and improving model outputs.
- **Deployment Strategies:** Approaches for putting models into production.

We recommend starting with the introductory notebooks and progressing to the advanced topics as you build your knowledge.
