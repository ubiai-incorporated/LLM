# Notebooks

Welcome to the **Notebooks** section of the **Ubiai Incorporated LLM** repository! This area is dedicated to interactive, hands-on learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) through practical examples, experiments, and guided tutorials.

## About This Section

In this folder, you'll find a collection of well-documented notebooks designed to help you learn about:
- **Model Exploration and Analysis**
- **Data Generation and Processing**
- **Fine-Tuning and Customization of Models**
- **Evaluation and Testing of Model Performance**
- **Advanced Applications (e.g., RAG, Agents, and more)**

Whether you're a beginner eager to learn the basics or an advanced practitioner looking to refine your skills, these notebooks provide valuable insights and actionable code.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How You Will Learn

This section contains practical examples that will guide you through key concepts of working with LLMs. The materials in these notebooks are designed to be self-paced, and you can progress through them at your own speed. Each notebook is self-contained and richly commented, designed to guide you through various aspects of LLMs.

You will:

- **Learn by doing**: Each notebook provides hands-on lessons with working code examples. You can easily replicate the code and experiment with your own setups.
- **Work with real-world scenarios**: Learn how to apply LLMs to practical use cases, from simple analysis to more advanced applications like RAG systems.
- **Expand your knowledge**: As you explore these notebooks, you‚Äôll encounter both basic principles and advanced techniques, giving you a deep understanding of LLMs and their capabilities.

We recommend starting with the introductory notebooks and progressing to the advanced topics as you build your knowledge.
