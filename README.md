# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-3 for Psychology Question Answering Using LoRA and Unsloth

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning the **LLaMA-3** language model for psychology-focused question answering using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and **Unsloth**. By following this notebook, you will learn how to efficiently adapt a large language model for a specialized task in psychology, applying advanced techniques for memory-efficient fine-tuning.

Whether you're a machine learning enthusiast or a psychology researcher, this guide equips you with the tools and knowledge to build a robust question-answering system.

### Why Psychology?
Psychology involves complex concepts and nuanced language, making it an ideal candidate for AI-powered solutions. This project focuses on creating a fine-tuned model capable of understanding psychology-specific queries and providing accurate, context-aware answers. This could have applications in:
- **Educational tools** for psychology students.
- **Research assistance** for summarizing or analyzing psychological studies.
- **Mental health support systems** for preliminary guidance.

## Details

- **Step-by-step implementation:** Detailed instructions for fine-tuning the LLaMA-3 model.
- **LoRA Integration:** Memory-efficient fine-tuning by optimizing only a subset of model parameters.
- **Unsloth Framework:** Simplifies and streamlines LLM fine-tuning and deployment.
- **Psychology-Specific Dataset:** Focused on specialized question-answering tasks.
